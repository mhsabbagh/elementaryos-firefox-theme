## Credits

This is a fork from https://github.com/Zonnev/elementaryos-firefox-theme to get back window controls + Put the close buttons to the right + increase width size.

## Install

**Firefox does not support userChrome.css by default. Here are the steps to make it work:**

  1. Load **about:config** in the Firefox address bar.
  2. Confirm that you will be careful.
  3. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` using the search at the top.
  4. Toggle the preference by double clicking. True means Firefox supports the CSS files, False that it ignores them.

**Follow these steps to install userChrome.css:**

  1. Go to **about:support** in Firefox
  2. Application Basics > Profile Directory > Open Directory
  3. Create a folder named `chrome`
  4. Paste the userChrome.css in this folder
  5. Disable Title bar in the customization panel in Firefox.
  5. In the customization panel in Firefox you can move the new tab button to the left if you wish and use the dark mode option as well.
